The marinade:
1/4 cup Soy Sauce (all the way in the back, middle shelf, right hand side)
1/4 cup white wine (in the door)
1 tablespoon chopped garlic (big jar top left side)
1 tablespoon ginger (in a tube laying down on the left door, top shelf pocket)
1 pinch of salt
3-4 turns of fresh cracked pepper

Mix everything in a bowl.

Get a large plastic zip lock back, put the salmon and then the marinade in it. Close the bag, almost all the way and squeeze the air out (important), be careful not to squeeze to much or the marinade will shoot out like a water gun. Close the bag all the way.

Flip the bag every hour or two to make sure everything gets covered.

At least 2 hours, 8 hours is better.

This should be enough for 1.5lbs of salmon

Cut the salmon into individual servings

Make little foil pouches, put the salmon and a little of the marinade in each pouch

Preheat over to 350

Bake for about 15 minutes
