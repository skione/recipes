1 kind:
6 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon of dry yeast
2 cups warm water. (Nothing higher than 110Â° )
1/4 cup of oil (I've used olive,  vegetable, corn and canola) and it all comes out the same
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/4 teaspoon sea salt (it's what I use)  I'm sure you can use regular salt

In a mixer add the sugar,  warm water, salt and the yeast. Wait about 10-15 minutes until the yeast starts to bubble. 

With the mixer on low start adding the flour in, in 3 storage batches. Dough will be sticky but that's ok. If for some reason dough looks dry add in a drop (and I literally mean a drop of water at a time) until it comes together. 

When done,  take it out of the bowl. Flour the place where your putting it on (only a little)  Knead the dough into a ball and than cut in half and shape them into loaves. Put them in loaf pans that are sprayed.  Don't butter them we did that the first time and it left the bottom soggy.  Place each piece in the loafs wait about 3 hours until they proof covered with clean towels. 

Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes. You will smell it. Depends on your oven you might need another few minutes but you will see the top nice and golden brown.   When done take them out of the pans and put them on a cooking rack covered with a clean towel. Wait a few minutes (if you can lol) and use a serrated knife to slice. Enjoy with butter,  jam,  with whatever you like. ENJOY BON APPETITE
